# Hey there, I'm Aditya! 🚀

I’m a **Full Stack Developer** and **AI Engineer** who loves building things that actually work in the real world. While I enjoy the entire stack, my current obsession is **Voice AI**—specifically, how to make AI conversations feel as fluid and natural as talking to a friend.

Based in Karnataka, India, I spend my time bridging the gap between complex machine learning models and the people who need them.

### 🛠 What I’m good at

I don't just write code; I build infrastructure that scales. My toolkit is a mix of high-level AI orchestration and gritty backend engineering:

* 
**The AI Side:** I specialize in **LiveKit** for ultra-low latency voice agents (we're talking sub-500ms response times). I also work with **LangChain** and **RAG** to give LLMs a "memory" and a source of truth.


* 
**The Full Stack Side:** I’m a **Python** and **Node.js** enthusiast. I’ve got hands-on experience integrating everything from **Razorpay** for payments to **Shiprocket** for logistics.


* **The Cloud Side:** I believe a project isn't finished until it's deployed. I handle my own DevOps on **AWS**, managing everything from S3 buckets to Route53 DNS settings.

### 🌟 Projects I’m Proud Of

#### **TorqAgents — Voice Intelligence Platform**

This is my "flagship" project. It’s a production-ready voice AI that handles conversations with human-like speed. I built the secure token-based backend and a custom frontend that visualizes audio waveforms in real-time.

* 
**Tech:** LiveKit, Node.js, Express, WebSockets.



#### **Areca Nut Price Predictor**

Living in Karnataka, I wanted to build something for the local community. I developed an **LSTM time-series model** that helps farmers predict price trends so they know the best time to sell their harvest.

* 
**Tech:** Python, Pandas, LSTM.



#### **JD-Aware Screening Agent**

I got tired of "black box" AI, so I built an agent that screens candidates using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. It evaluates role fit strictly based on verified experience, making the hiring process transparent and fair.

### 📈 Experience

**Technical Solutions Partner @ Torq Designs** *(2024 – Present)* I helped pivot a design agency into a tech-driven solutions firm. Instead of just "making things look pretty," I started building custom automations and e-commerce infrastructures that solved real operational headaches for our clients.
